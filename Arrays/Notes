Arrays (DOCFC)
Array is a data structure which is used to store the collection of elements of same type.
It is an object in java. 
The elements are stored in the contiguous memory location
Arrays are fixed in size after creation and array is zero index based.

Array can be created in two ways:- 
Literal approach : int[ ] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
New Keyword approach : int[] arr = new int[5];
By using the array index we can insert the values.

Types of arrays
One Dimensional Array : - above approach is of one dimensional array
Two Dimensional Array
Literal approach: - int[][] matrix = {{1,2}, {3,4}, {5,6}};
New keyword approach :- int[][] matrix = new int[3][2];
